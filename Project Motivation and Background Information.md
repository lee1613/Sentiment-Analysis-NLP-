# Sentiment-Analysis-NLP 
This is a project done by a group of students as part of the submission of assignment in a NUS module IT 1244 Artificial Intelligence: Technology and Impact. 

The topic is about Sentiment Analysis, which is to classify a sentence either as a positive or negative tone. More details and background information can be found in the report in the same file.

Sentiment Analysis is being carried out using 5 different AI model independently. These 5 models are Logistic Regression, 
K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN), Naive Bayes(NB), Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

Credit is given to Daniel Cheng, Li Yi Han and Lee Jun Yuan for creating the 5 different AI models.
